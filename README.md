# go-concurrent-cafeteria
A Go application written to study some design patterns and concurrency.

Inspired by the [dotGo 2017 - Sameer Ajmani - Simulating a real-world system in Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YK0viplIl4) from the [Go Learn Concurrency wiki](https://go.dev/wiki/LearnConcurrency)
